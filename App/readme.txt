3. Q) Why is the earth round?

A) The earth is round because of the force of gravity. Gravity is a force that pulls
objects towards each other, and it is the same force that causes objects to fall to the
ground. On Earth, gravity pulls the oceans and land masses towards the center of the
planet, creating a spherical shape. This shape is also known as an oblate spheroid, which
is slightly flattened at the poles.

4. Q) Prove that Sun is the center of this universe

A) The sun is the center of our solar system, and it is the source of energy for all the
planets in the system. This is because the sun's gravity is so strong that it holds all
the planets in orbit around it. Additionally, the sun is the brightest object in the sky,
and it is the only star visible to the naked eye. All of these facts point to the sun
being the center of our solar system and the source of energy for all the planets in the
system.
